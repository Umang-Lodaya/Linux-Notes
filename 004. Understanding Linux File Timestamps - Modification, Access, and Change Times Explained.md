### Linux File Timestamps

In Linux, files have multiple timestamps that track when they were last modified, changed, or accessed. These timestamps can be viewed using different variations of the `ls` command.

#### Types of File Timestamps:

1. **Modification Time**: When the file's content was last modified or updated.
2. **Change Time**: When the file's metadata (e.g., permissions, renaming) or its location in the file system was last changed.
3. **Access Time**: When the file was last accessed (viewed directly or indirectly by a user or a program).

#### Commands to View Timestamps:

- `ls -l`: Shows the **modification time** of the files and directories, i.e., when they were last updated.
- `ls -lc`: Displays the **change time**, which is when the file's metadata or location was last modified.
- `ls -lu`: Displays the **access time**, showing when the file was last opened or accessed.

#### Example:
Let's say you have a file named `example.txt`. You can use the following commands to view its timestamps:

```bash
ls -l example.txt
```

Output:
```bash
-rw-r--r-- 1 user user 1048 Sep 14 12:30 example.txt
```
- **Sep 14 12:30**: This is the **modification time**, indicating when the content of `example.txt` was last updated.

```bash
ls -lc example.txt
```

Output:
```bash
-rw-r--r-- 1 user user 1048 Sep 14 13:00 example.txt
```
- **Sep 14 13:00**: This is the **change time**, showing when the file's metadata or directory location was last changed (e.g., if you moved `example.txt` to another directory or changed its permissions).

```bash
ls -lu example.txt
```

Output:
```bash
-rw-r--r-- 1 user user 1048 Sep 14 14:10 example.txt
```
- **Sep 14 14:10**: This is the **access time**, indicating when `example.txt` was last viewed or accessed.

#### Summary of Commands:
- `ls -l`: Shows the **modification time** – when the file was last updated.
- `ls -lc`: Shows the **change time** – when the file’s metadata or location was last modified.
- `ls -lu`: Shows the **access time** – when the file was last accessed by a user or process.

For more options and details, you can always view the manual pages with:

```bash
man ls
```

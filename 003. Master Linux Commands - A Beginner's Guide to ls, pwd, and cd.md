### Linux `ls` Command

The `ls` command (List Directory Contents) is used to view the files and folders present in the current working directory.

```bash
ls
```

#### Common `ls` Options:
- `ls -a`: Displays all files and directories, including hidden ones.
- `ls -l`: Displays files and directories in long-form format, including permissions, size, and last modification date.
- `ls -t`: Sorts files by modification time, showing the most recently modified files first.
- `ls -rt`: Displays files sorted by time in reverse order (oldest first).

A commonly used combination is:

```bash
ls -lrt
```

This shows the contents in long-form format and sorts them by increasing modification time.

For more options and details, check the manual pages:

```bash
man ls

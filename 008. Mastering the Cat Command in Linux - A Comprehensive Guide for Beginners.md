### Linux `cat` Command

The `cat` command is used to concatenate file(s) and display their content on the standard output. It can also be used to copy the content of one or more files into another file.

#### Basic Usage:
- To display the content of a file:
  ```bash
  cat a.txt
  ```
- To display the content of multiple files:
  ```bash
  cat a.txt b.txt
  ```

#### Copying File Content:
- To concatenate two files and copy their content into a new file:
  ```bash
  cat a.txt b.txt > c.txt
  ```
  In this example, the content of `a.txt` and `b.txt` is concatenated and written into `c.txt`. If `c.txt` doesn't exist, it is created. The `>` operator **overwrites** the file content.

- To **append** the content to an existing file:
  ```bash
  cat a.txt >> c.txt
  ```
  This appends the content of `a.txt` to `c.txt` without overwriting it.

#### Reversing Content:
- To **vertically reverse** the order of lines in a file, use the `tac` command (reverse `cat`):
  ```bash
  tac file.txt
  ```
- To **horizontally reverse** the characters of each line, use the `rev` command:
  ```bash
  rev file.txt
  ```

For more options and usage, you can refer to the manual page:

```bash
man cat
```

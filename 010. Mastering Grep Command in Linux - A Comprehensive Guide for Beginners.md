### Linux `grep` Command

The `grep` command is used to search for a pattern in a text document. It can search plain text or use regular expressions to find the desired pattern.

#### Basic Usage:
- Search for a pattern in a file:
  ```shell
  grep "man" file.txt
  ```
  This command searches for the pattern `"man"` in `file.txt`.

#### Case-Insensitive Search:
By default, `grep` is case-sensitive. Use the `-i` option for case-insensitive search:
  ```bash
  grep -i "man" file.txt
  ```

#### Useful `grep` Options:
- `-i` : Case-insensitive search.
- `-c` : Count occurrences of the pattern.
  ```bash
  grep -c "man" file.txt
  ```
- `-n` : Display line numbers where the pattern is found.
  ```bash
  grep -n "man" file.txt
  ```
- `-w` : Match the whole word, not just a part of it.
  ```bash
  grep -w "man" file.txt
  ```
- `-B3` : Print 3 lines **before** the matching pattern.
  ```bash
  grep -B3 "man" file.txt
  ```
- `-A3` : Print 3 lines **after** the matching pattern.
  ```bash
  grep -A3 "man" file.txt
  ```
- `-C3` : Print 3 lines **before and after** the matching pattern.
  ```bash
  grep -C3 "man" file.txt
  ```
- `-r` : Recursively search through all files in a directory.
  ```bash
  grep -r "man" [DIRECTORY]
  ```

#### Example:
- Search for the word "man" in `a.txt`, ignore case, and display line numbers:
  ```bash
  grep -in "man" a.txt
  ```

`grep` is an incredibly powerful command when combined with other options and commands, making it ideal for searching through logs, directories, and large text files.

For more options, refer to the manual page:

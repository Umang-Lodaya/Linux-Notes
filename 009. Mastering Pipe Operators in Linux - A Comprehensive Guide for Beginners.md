### Pipe (`|`) Operator

The pipe (`|`) operator is used when you want to use the output of one command as the input for another command. This allows chaining of commands to perform complex operations efficiently.

#### Example 1:
- List the contents of a directory in long and human-readable form, then **sort** the output:
  ```bash
  ls -lh | sort
  ```

#### Example 2:
- Count the number of lines in a file:
  ```bash
  cat file.txt | wc -l
  ```
  Here, `cat file.txt` outputs the content of the file, and `wc -l` counts the number of lines in the output.

For more advanced uses, you can chain multiple commands using pipes to create efficient workflows in the terminal.

### Linux `mkdir` Command

The `mkdir` command is used to create directories (folders) in Linux.

#### Basic Usage:
- To create a single directory:

```bash
mkdir movies
```
This creates a new directory named `movies`.

- To create multiple directories at the same time:

```bash
mkdir horror comedy action
```
This creates three new directories: `horror`, `comedy`, and `action`.

#### Creating Nested Directories:
- To create a directory inside another directory in one command, use the `-p` (parent) option:

```bash
mkdir -p kids/animated
```

This creates the directory `kids` with a subdirectory `animated` inside it. Without the `-p` option, it would throw an error if the parent directory (`kids`) doesn’t exist.

For more options, view the manual pages with:

```bash
man mkdir
```

### Linux `touch` Command

The `touch` command is primarily used to update the access and modification times of a file to the current time. It can also be used to create new, empty files.

#### Basic Usage:
- To create a new file or update the time of an existing file:

```bash
touch file.txt
```

If `file.txt` doesn’t exist, this command creates it. If it already exists, it updates the file's access and modification times to the current time.

- To create or update multiple files:

```bash
touch file1.txt file2.txt
```

#### Modifying Timestamps:
- To change only the **modification time**:

```bash
touch -m file.txt
```

- To change only the **access time**:

```bash
touch -a file.txt
```

#### Tip:
You can use the `stat` command to view detailed information about a file, including its modification and access times:

```bash
stat file.txt
```

This displays details such as:
- Modification time
- Access time
- File size
- File permissions, etc.

For more options, check the manual pages:

```bash
man touch
```

### Linux `file` Command

The `file` command is used to determine the file type.

#### Example Usage:
To find out what type of file a specific file is:

```bash
file abc.txt
```

This will return a description of the file type, such as "ASCII text" or "executable".

For more details, view the manual pages:

```bash
man file
```

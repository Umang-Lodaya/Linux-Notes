### Linux Command Structure

Linux commands are generally composed of three main parts:

1. **Command Name**
2. **Options**
3. **Arguments**

In the terminal, this structure looks like:

```bash
command-name + options + arguments
```

#### Example 1: `cat` Command
The `cat` command is used to display the content of a file in the terminal.

```bash
cat filename.type
```

For example, the command:

```bash
cat abc.txt
```

Will display the contents of `abc.txt`:

```bash
Hello World
I am Umang Lodaya
```

In this example:
- `cat` is the **Command Name**.
- `abc.txt` is the **Argument** (the file whose content you want to display).

##### Using Options with `cat`
You can also pass options using a `-`. For example:

```bash
cat -n abc.txt
```

This will display the content of `abc.txt` along with line numbers:

```bash
1 Hello World
2 I am Umang Lodaya
```

- `-n` is the **Option** that tells `cat` to number the lines.
- You can use the full version of the option as well: `cat --number abc.txt` works the same as `cat -n abc.txt`.

#### Note: Short vs Long Options
- Short options are usually prefixed with `-` (e.g., `-n`).
- Full-form options are prefixed with `--` (e.g., `--number`).

#### Example 2: `ncal` Command
The `ncal` command is used to display calendars.

- `ncal` shows the calendar of the current month.
- `ncal year` displays the calendar of the entire year.
- `ncal month year` displays the calendar for a specific month of the mentioned year.

##### Using Options with `ncal`
You can also pass options to modify the behavior of `ncal`:

- `ncal -w` shows the calendar of the current month with week numbers.
- `ncal -M` displays the calendar with Monday as the first day of the week.

You can combine multiple options. For example:

```bash
ncal -w -M
```

Or, you can combine them in a single form:

```bash
ncal -wM
```
